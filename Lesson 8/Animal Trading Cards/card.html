				<p>Koalas are often referred to as bears, but they are not bears at all! Koalas are in fact marsupials or pouched animals. When a female koala gives birth she carries her baby in her pouch for 6 months. When the baby emerges from the pouch it rides on the mother's back or clings to her belly until it is about a year old. Koalas live in Eastern Australia where there are plenty of eucalyptus trees for them to eat. They have sharp claws and spend most of there times in trees. Koalas can sleep for up to 18 hours per day!</p>
